###An HMVC development framework

Welcome to the wonderful world of Nooku.

The aim of this documentation is to introduce some of the important concepts in Nooku for any competent PHP developer, along with some simple to follow examples, in order to get up to speed as quickly as possible.

Nooku is a framework like no other, and some of the concepts and design patterns that it uses may not be familiar to you. Fear not, they will be introduced in time and explained in detail where necessary.

A few assumptions are being made throught these documents:

* you know PHP 5 to a competent level, this includes OOP
* you know what an abstract class and interface is
* you know what MVC is
* you understand the HTTP verbs
* you understand the principles of REST

If you donâ€™t know what these things are, start googling :)

To get started, the git repo is at `git://git.assembla.com/nooku-framework.git`

Happy coding! :)
